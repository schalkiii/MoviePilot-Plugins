# agent-resource-officer changelog

## 0.1.46

- Added calibration guidance for long-running external-agent sessions with `校准影视技能`.
- Tightened title-resource routing so `下载` stays on MP/PT, `转存` defaults to 115, and explicit Quark transfer remains opt-in.
- Documented Cookie refresh and repair flows for Quark and HDHive browser-cookie recovery.

## 0.1.42

- Added `quark-cookie-refresh` to run the local Quark browser-cookie export tool, write the full webpage cookie back into MoviePilot/AgentResourceOfficer, and restart `moviepilot-v2`.
- Added `quark-transfer-repair` to refresh the Quark webpage cookie and optionally retry one failed Quark transfer command after MoviePilot comes back.
- Documented the fixed natural-language intents `刷新夸克Cookie` and `修复夸克转存`, plus the narrower auto-repair trigger guidance for explicit Quark login-state failures only.

## 0.1.41

- Added `hdhive-cookie-refresh` to run the local HDHive browser-cookie export tool, write the full webpage cookie back into MoviePilot/AgentResourceOfficer, and restart `moviepilot-v2`.
- Added `hdhive-checkin-repair` to refresh the HDHive webpage cookie and immediately retry one `影巢签到`.
- Documented the fixed natural-language intents `刷新影巢Cookie` and `修复影巢签到`, plus the auto-repair guidance for HDHive sign-in cookie failures.
- Sanitized helper output so browser-export diagnostics no longer echo raw cookie/token material back to the caller.

## 0.1.40

- Added `deprecated_aliases` to the helper-facing `external-agent` payload.
- Marked `workbuddy` as deprecated in the helper command catalog while keeping it as a compatibility alias.
- Synced README / EXTERNAL_AGENTS wording so human-facing docs match the new alias semantics.

## 0.1.39

- Added `entry_playbooks` to the helper-facing external-agent payload and request-template summaries so agents can read ready-to-run helper commands, HTTP endpoints, Tool names, and recommended fields from one place.
- Tightened helper selftest coverage for the new playbook metadata and missing-detail request-template summaries.

## 0.1.38

- Added orchestration metadata to the helper and template summaries, including service/client roles, entry patterns, and the preferred startup -> decide -> route -> followup flow.
- Clarified that external agents, MP built-in agents, and the Feishu channel all reuse the same assistant protocol instead of maintaining separate state machines.

## 0.1.35

- Added `execution_loop_contract` to the external-agent payload so a new external agent can bootstrap itself from a structured startup -> decide -> route -> policy -> followup loop.
- Documented the minimal external-agent execution loop in the Skill and external-agent guides.

## 0.1.34

- Added `execution_policy_contract` to the external-agent payload so external agents can consume the helper's execution behavior classes without reading repository docs first.
- Documented the five recommended behavior branches (`auto_continue`, `auto_continue_then_wait_confirmation`, `wait_user_confirmation`, `show_only`, `stop`) across the Skill and external-agent guides.

## 0.1.33

- Extended the helper-owned execution policy summary to legacy helper summaries such as `decide`, `auto`, `doctor`, and `recover`, so external agents no longer need two different parsing paths.
- Added selftest coverage for legacy helper summary auto-continue and wait-confirmation behavior.

## 0.1.32

- Added a helper-owned command execution policy summary for `--summary-only`, including `recommended_agent_behavior`, `auto_run_command`, `confirm_command`, `display_command`, `stop_after_auto`, and `reason`.
- Added `auto_continue_rule` to the external-agent payload so other agents can decide when to auto-run the preferred command and when to stop for confirmation.
- Added selftest coverage for the new auto-continue decision layer.

## 0.1.31

- Preserved compact command execution semantics in helper summaries: `command_policy`, `preferred_requires_confirmation`, `fallback_requires_confirmation`, and `can_auto_run_preferred`.
- Taught `summary_command()` to use those confirmation flags instead of only falling back to the old helper inspect/execute flow.
- Added selftest coverage for top-level command confirmation behavior.

## 0.1.30

- Added top-level compact command extraction for `route`, `pick`, `workflow`, `plan-execute`, and `followup`.
- Added `--summary-only` / `--command-only` support for those commands, so external agents can ask the helper for just the next command.
- Added `next_command_rule` to the external-agent payload and documented the top-level `preferred_command` / `compact_commands` contract.

## 0.1.29

- Added `preferences_recipe_command` to the external-agent payload.
- Taught recipe command generation that `preferences_onboarding` maps to the direct `preferences` helper command.
- Added selftest coverage for the preferences onboarding recipe and payload handoff.

## 0.1.28

- Added `local_ingest_recipe_command` to the external-agent payload.
- Taught recipe command generation that `mp_ingest_status` and `mp_local_diagnose` map to direct workflow helper commands.
- Preserved `diagnosis_summary` in compact helper output so local/PT ingest diagnostics remain structured for external agents.

## 0.1.27

- Added `post_execute_recipe_command` to the external-agent payload.
- Taught recipe command generation that `execution_followup` maps to `python3 scripts/aro_request.py followup`.
- Documented the `templates --recipe followup` low-token entry for post-execution tracking.

## 0.1.26

- Added `followup`, a direct helper command for the plugin-owned `query_execution_followup` action.
- Added positional `plan-xxx` support for `followup`, so `python3 scripts/aro_request.py followup plan-xxx` works without `--plan-id`.
- Added `followup_command` to the external-agent handoff payload, so other agents can continue after `plan-execute` without guessing the next raw action.

## 0.1.25

- Preserved `follow_up_hint` in compact helper output, so `plan-execute` and related commands no longer drop the plugin's next-step hint.
- Added a selftest case for `follow_up_hint` passthrough.

## 0.1.24

- Added positional argument support for `workflow`, so `python3 scripts/aro_request.py workflow mp_media_detail 蜘蛛侠` works without `--workflow` and `--keyword`.
- Added positional session support for `session`, `session-clear`, and `history`, so `python3 scripts/aro_request.py session default` and `python3 scripts/aro_request.py history agent:demo` work without `--session`.
- Added positional `plan-xxx` support for `plans` and `plans-clear`.

## 0.1.23

- Added positional argument support for `pick`, so `python3 scripts/aro_request.py pick 1` and `python3 scripts/aro_request.py pick 1 详情` work without `--choice` or `--action`.
- Added positional plan support for `plan-execute`, so `python3 scripts/aro_request.py plan-execute plan-xxx` works without `--plan-id`.
- Updated the external-agent handoff payload to prefer the shorter positional `pick` command.

## 0.1.22

- Added positional text support for `route`, so `python3 scripts/aro_request.py route "盘搜搜索 大君夫人"` works without `--text`.
- Kept the old `--text` form for compatibility.

## 0.1.21

- Added direct `--command-only` helper output for the `mp_pt` and `recommend` recipes.
- Changed recipe command selection to execute the first safe read step directly even when later recipe steps require confirmation.

## 0.1.20

- Added `mp_pt_recipe_command` and `mp_recommend_recipe_command` to the external-agent handoff payload.
- Documented `mp_pt` and `recommend` request-template recipes for MP native PT and recommendation flows.

## 0.1.19

- Added workflow helper flags for MP download task management: `--status`, `--hash`, `--target`, `--control`, `--downloader`, and `--delete-files`.
- Added examples for querying, pausing, resuming, and deleting MP download tasks through AgentResourceOfficer.

## 0.1.18

- Documented the recommendation-to-search chain for external agents.

## 0.1.17

- Changed HDHive search helper default to `media_type=auto`, so uncertain titles are not filtered as movies before TV candidates can be found.

## 0.1.15

- Documented compact `score_summary` for choosing scored cloud/PT results without parsing long messages.

- Documented cloud/PT source-specific scoring and MP native search/download/subscribe/recommend workflows.
- Updated the external-agent handoff prompt to check preferences before automated resource tasks.
- Changed `workflow` helper behavior so read-only workflows execute directly while write workflows still generate a dry-run plan by default.

## 0.1.12

- Added `external-agent` helper command to print a compact external-agent prompt and minimal tool contract.
- Added `external-agent --full` to print the bundled external-agent handoff guide directly from the Skill package.
